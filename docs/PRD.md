## 4. Functional Requirements

### Chess Mechanics Implementation

**Standard Piece Movement**
- **Pawn**: Forward one square (two from starting position), diagonal capture
- **Knight**: L-shaped movement (2+1 squares)
- **Bishop**: Diagonal movement any distance
- **Rook**: Horizontal/vertical movement any distance
- **Queen**: Combined rook and bishop movement
- **King**: One square in any direction

**Special Move Rules**

*Castling Requirements:*
- King and rook haven't moved
- No pieces between king and rook
- King not in check, doesn't move through check, doesn't end in check
- Kingside: King moves two squares right
- Queenside: King moves two squares left

*En Passant Capture:*
- Opponent pawn advances two squares
- Capturing pawn on fifth rank
- Capture must occur immediately after opponent's move
- Results in diagonal capture with removal of passed pawn

*Pawn Promotion:*
- Pawn reaches opposite end of board
- Player selects promotion piece (Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight)
- Default to Queen for AI promotion
- UI modal for human player selection

**Game State Detection**

*Check Detection:*
- King under direct attack
- Visual indication on king square
- Move validation prevents moving into check
- Must resolve check on next move

*Checkmate Detection:*
- King in check with no legal moves
- Game immediately ends
- Winner declaration displayed
- Board state frozen

*Stalemate Detection:*
- Player has no legal moves but not in check
- Game ends in draw
- Clear stalemate indication
- Option to review final position

**State Management Design**
```typescript
interface GameState {
  position: Chess;
  fen: string;
  turn: 'white' | 'black';
  selectedSquare: Square | null;
  legalMoves: Move[];
  moveHistory: Move[];
  gameStatus: 'active' | 'check' | 'checkmate' | 'stalemate';
  aiDifficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
  isAIThinking: boolean;
}
```

### AI Implementation Approach

**Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning**
```typescript
function minimax(
  depth: number,
  position: Chess,
  alpha: number,
  beta: number,
  maximizingPlayer: boolean
): number {
  if (depth === 0 || position.game_over()) {
    return evaluatePosition(position);
  }
  
  const moves = position.moves({ verbose: true });
  let bestValue = maximizingPlayer ? -Infinity : Infinity;
  
  for (const move of moves) {
    position.move(move);
    const value = minimax(depth - 1, position, alpha, beta, !maximizingPlayer);
    position.undo();
    
    if (maximizingPlayer) {
      bestValue = Math.max(bestValue, value);
      alpha = Math.max(alpha, bestValue);
    } else {
      bestValue = Math.min(bestValue, value);
      beta = Math.min(beta, bestValue);
    }
    
    if (beta <= alpha) break;
  }
  
  return bestValue;
}
```

**Position Evaluation Function**
- Material balance (piece values in centipawns)
- Piece-square tables for positional advantage
- King safety evaluation
- Pawn structure analysis
- Center control bonus
- Development incentive in opening

**Web Worker Integration**
- Offload AI calculations to prevent UI blocking
- Message passing for position and move communication
- Progress updates during deep searches
- Cancellable calculations for new game starts

**Evaluation Function Components**
```typescript
function evaluatePosition(position: Chess): number {
  let score = 0;
  
  // Material balance
  score += getMaterialBalance(position);
  
  // Piece-square tables
  score += getPositionalScore(position);
  
  // King safety
  score += evaluateKingSafety(position);
  
  // Pawn structure
  score += evaluatePawnStructure(position);
  
  // Mobility
  score += countLegalMoves(position);
  
  return position.turn() === 'w' ? score : -score;
}
```
